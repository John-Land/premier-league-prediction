# Predicting the beautiful game, with a game of the beautiful game

## Premier League Match Predictions with FIFA game data

Ever since playing the beautiful game as a child, watching my first football game of Liverpool FC and my first world cup in 1998, the game has not stopped fascinating me. Not surprisingly, this has also led to a fascination with the FIFA football game. The data collected by EA Sports for the FIFA football game has been ever expanding and becoming increasingly real time. Player and team statistics used to be updated once a year with the new game release, but nowadays, player and team statistics get updated regularly during the season, reflecting players and teams in and out of form, as well as new players emerging during the season. <br>

With the increasing close to real time data collected for the FIFA football game, I pose the question whether it is possible to predict the outcome of a match, based on data from the FIFA football game?

As a premise we put ourselves in the shoes of many football fans out there.
We are sitting in front of our game console, playing the latest FIFA game. It's one hour before kickoff of the match of our favorite Premier League football team. As usual, the team news for both teams has just been released.
Can we predict the outcome of the Premier League match, based on the FIFA game statistics of the announced starting eleven of both sides?

Before we can answer this question, we will have to prepare the data for analysis, which will be part 1 of this notebook.<br>

Part two will then continue with Exploratory Data Analysis, to gain some insights from the data. After we will run several machine learning algorithms, to try to predict the outcome of the game.


## Part 1 Data Pre-processing

Before we can start, we will first need a dataset. For this project I will be using the "European Soccer Database". <br>
The dataset can be found under the following link on Kaggle: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)

The dataset contains match information for 25,000 matches, spanning seasons 2008/2009 to 2015/2016. In addition, it contains the player and team data for the same seasons from the FIFA football game. As the data is saved on an SQL database, in the first part of the next section we will extract the data from the database, before merging the match, player and team information into one data frame.

### Data Extraction from SQLlite Database
For the data extraction in SQL, I will be using the sqlite3 library. This offers a seamless transition from SQL to pandas, as we can directly extract the data from the database with sql queries into a Pandas Dataframe.



```python
import pandas as pd # data processing
import sqlite3 #SQL library to extract data from sql database

#display max columns and rows, to be able to inspect big data tables
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
```

Below line is to connect the google colab instance to google drive. If run outside colab, below code is ignored.


```python
# conntects to google drive if ran in colab
# ignored if ran outside of colab

if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

The following code first connects to the SQL database saved in the folder under the 'path' variable in case it is ran within colab. If ran outside of colab, the SQL database should be saved in the same folder as the notebook.


```python
# connect to SQL database in google drive if ran in colab. 
# connet to SQL database in notebook folder if ran outside of colab

if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):
    path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Python_Data_Programming_Coursework/'
else:
    path = str()
database = path + 'database.sqlite'
conn = sqlite3.connect(database)
```

The next few lines of code first extract an overview of all tables in the database. Then I download the tables from the SQL database into a dataframe with the sqlite3 library.

It may be possible to extract the data in a more efficient manner, merging several tables during the extraction. However, as the SQL query code would get involved, I decided to do most of the table merging activity in Pandas.

For the "Match" table, in the first download I only extract five entries, to get an understanding of the column structure. This is the base table which will be used to merge the player and team data on.


```python
# get overview of tables in SQL database
tables = pd.read_sql("""SELECT *
                      FROM sqlite_master
                      WHERE type='table';""", conn)
tables
```

The below code forms our base match table, to later merge the player and team data into.
To enable us to merge the detailed player data and the team data into the match table later, I keep that player and team IDs, which will be used as keys to merge the match table with the Player Attributes and Team Attributes tables. <br>
To limit the download of unnecessary data, I join the Match table with the Country and League tables before extraction, then limit the extraction to matches where the Country name is "England". This limits the extraction to Premier League matches only.

### Data merging and pre-processing in Pandas
Now that we have the base match table, the next challenge is to merge the team and player data into the match table. 

Our end goal is to have a table where each row represents a match, including the latest team and player data from the FIFA game, and the match result.
With this structure we can later use the table for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

To add the team data, I first check when the team data was updated.
Unfortunately, it seems like the team data was not updated regularly in our database. This may become problematic for the usefulness of the team data for match prediction.



```python
# unique dates of team data information
list(team_attributes.date.unique())
```




    ['2010-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2014-09-19 00:00:00',
     '2015-09-10 00:00:00',
     '2011-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2012-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2013-09-20 00:00:00']



To ensure that no information from the future is used in predicting the match outcome, it must be ensured that the team and player data used to predict the match outcome, is information from before the match.

To ensure this for the team data, I build a dictionary linking the latest update of the team data to the closest season after.

This will be used together with the team IDs to merge the team attributes data into the match table, for both the home team and the away team.


```python
#create team data dictionary to ensure no data leakage
dictionary_season = {'2010-02-22 00:00:00': '2010/2011',
                     '2011-02-22 00:00:00': '2011/2012',
                     '2012-02-22 00:00:00': '2012/2013',
                     '2013-09-20 00:00:00': '2013/2014',
                     '2014-09-19 00:00:00': '2014/2015',
                    '2015-09-10 00:00:00': '2015/2016'
                     }
```

The following next few lines of code add the season column to the player attributes data, based on above dictionary. <br>

Then I merge the team attributes table twice into the match table. Once for the home team based on the home team ID and once for the away team based on the away team ID. <br>

The new columns can be seen on the right side of the match table.


```python
# add season column to team attributes tablle, based on above dictionary mapping
team_attributes['season'] = team_attributes ['date'].map(dictionary_season)
```


```python
#merge home team attributes into the match table
epl_matches = epl_matches.merge(team_attributes, how='inner', left_on=['season', 'home_team_api_id'], right_on=['season', 'team_api_id'])

#add home team marker to home team attributes column
old_column_list = []
new_column_list = []
for column in team_attributes.columns.drop('season'):
  old_column_list.append(column)
  new_column_list.append(column+str('_home_team'))
for i in range(len(old_column_list)):
  epl_matches = epl_matches.rename(columns={old_column_list[i]: new_column_list[i]})

epl_matches.head(5)
```

Before moving on to the player data, the next few lines check for missing data points, and delete columns with most team attribute values missing.

I also delete some rows where ID information is missing. As these are not measured values but arbitrary IDs, imputing the values is not an option is this case.


```python
# check for total number of matches in dataset
total_num_matches = epl_matches.shape[0]
total_num_matches
```




    2280




```python
# check for missing values
epl_matches.isna().sum()
```

```python
# remove two team attribute columns, as most values missing
epl_matches = epl_matches.drop(columns=['buildUpPlayDribbling_home_team', 'buildUpPlayDribbling_away_team'])
```


```python
# remove rows with missing values
epl_matches = epl_matches.dropna()
print(total_num_matches - epl_matches.shape[0],'out of',total_num_matches,'matches were deleted from the dataset due to missing team attribute or player ID information')
```

    39 out of 2280 matches were deleted from the dataset due to missing team attribute or player ID information
    

Next, I merge the player data for the 11 starting players on each side, in total 22 players into the match table. <br>

To do this I define a column list for the player ID columns in the match table, then loop through the column list and merge the player attributes list into the match table for each player ID.<br>

To ensure that we only merge player data into the match table, that was available before the match date, I use the pandas.merge_asof function.
Refer to following link in the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge_asof.html). Quoting the pandas documentation:<em>" A “backward” search selects the last row in the right DataFrame whose ‘on’ key is less than or equal to the left’s key."</em><br>

Therefore, if we sort both tables by the date key ascending, we can ensure that during the merge process, the date key in the right table, in this case player attributes, will be less than or equal to the date in the match table. With this we have ensured that the player data extracted is from before the match date.


```python
# number of unique update dates in player attribute table
Player_Attributes.date.unique().shape
```




    (197,)




```python
# generate player ID column list, which will be used as keys to merge the match table with the player attributes table
team_players = ['home_player_1',
                'home_player_2', 
                'home_player_3', 
                'home_player_4', 
                'home_player_5',
                'home_player_6', 
                'home_player_7', 
                'home_player_8', 
                'home_player_9',
                'home_player_10',
                'home_player_11',
                'away_player_1', 
                'away_player_2',
                'away_player_3', 
                'away_player_4', 
                'away_player_5', 
                'away_player_6',
                'away_player_7', 
                'away_player_8', 
                'away_player_9', 
                'away_player_10',
                'away_player_11']

#below two loops ensure player ID columns have the correct formatting
for player in team_players:
  epl_matches[player] = pd.to_numeric(epl_matches[player])

for player in team_players:
  epl_matches[player] = epl_matches[player].astype('int64')
```


```python
#ensure correct date formatting of date columns
epl_matches['match_date'] = pd.to_datetime(epl_matches['match_date'])
Player_Attributes['date'] = pd.to_datetime(Player_Attributes['date'])

#sort both match and player attribute tables by date ascending.
epl_matches = epl_matches.sort_values(by='match_date', ascending=True)
Player_Attributes = Player_Attributes.sort_values(by='date', ascending=True)
```


```python
# merge the player attributes of all 22 starting players into the match table
for player in team_players:
  epl_matches = pd.merge_asof(epl_matches, Player_Attributes, left_on='match_date', right_on='date', left_by = player, right_by ='player_api_id', direction='backward', suffixes= ("","_"+player))
```


```python
# add missing ending label for home player one column names
for i in epl_matches.columns[72:113]:
  epl_matches = epl_matches.rename(columns={i: i+str('_home_player_1')})
```

After merging the player attribute table 22 times into the match table, we have the player attributes for all 22 starting players for each match.
Refer to the columns on the right of below table, to see the player attributes.


```python
# overview of match table after merging in player data for 22 starting players
epl_matches.head(5)

## Part 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

In part two of this notebook, we will explore the match table to gain some insights of the premier league match data. <br>

Considering our final goal of prediction, the match outcome, I will first analyse the match outcome data and then further expand our analysis and try to find variables which could help us predict the match outcome. <br>

For Exploratory Data Analysis I will be using below four libraries.
1. Numpy for scientific computing
2. Scipy for statistical analysis
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Seaborn for data visualization


```python
import numpy as np #scientific computing/linear algebra
from scipy.stats import norm #scientific computing library. Used for confidence interval calculations

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #data visualization
import seaborn as sns #data visualization
```

Before going deeper into the analysis, let us quickly get a general idea of the scope and shape of our match table.


```python
print("The match table covers the following premier league seasons:", np.unique(epl_matches['season']))
```

    The match table covers the following premier league seasons: ['2010/2011' '2011/2012' '2012/2013' '2013/2014' '2014/2015' '2015/2016']
    


```python
print("In total we have", epl_matches.shape[0], "matches in the dataset.")
```

    In total we have 2179 matches in the dataset.
    

### Match result
First let us analyse the overall match result.
Below bar chart shows the count of the three different match outcomes. <br>
Note that the data we are considering covers below two seasons.




```python
sns.catplot(x="result", data=epl_matches,  kind="count")
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
```


    
![png](output_55_0.png)
    


Clearly home wins make up the biggest portion of the match results. <br>
The number of draws and away wins are close to each other, with slightly more away wins than draws overall.


```python
summary_table = epl_matches.groupby(['season']).agg({'home_win': ['sum'], 'away_win': ['sum'], 'draw': ['sum']})
summary_table.columns = summary_table.columns.droplevel(1)

for i in range(summary_table.shape[0]):
  summary_table.iloc[i] = summary_table.iloc[i]/np.sum(summary_table.iloc[i])

summary_table.columns = ['home_win_%', 'away_win_%', "draw_%"]

summary_table
```

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 5)
ax = sns.lineplot(data=summary_table)
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
plt.show()
```

The home win % was consistently above the away win and draw % for the seasons in our dataset. <br>

In terms of away wins versus draws, in 4 out of 6 seasons in our data set, the away win % was higher than the draw %.


```python
 fig, ax = plt.subplots()
 fig.set_size_inches(10, 5)
 ax = sns.boxplot(data=summary_table, orient="h")
 plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_60_0.png)
    


The above boxplots show once again, the clear difference between % of games ending in a home win and the other results.

#### Home win percentage
In the next two lines, I calculate the % of games ending in a win, as well as the 95% confidence intervall of the % of games ending in a win. <br>

Using the Central Limit Theorem, we can assume that sample means are normally distribute with large samples. This allows us to calculate the confidence interval of our sample mean with the normal distribution. As the sample is sufficiently large with over 2000 games, I use the z score from the standard normal distribution instead of the t distribution for confidence interval calculations.


```python
home_win_perc = np.sum(epl_matches['home_win'])/epl_matches.shape[0]
print('The home win % in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was', (home_win_perc*100).round(2),'%')
```

    The home win % in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was 44.93 %
    


```python
p = home_win_perc # sample proportion
n = epl_matches.shape[0] #sample size

#95% confidence interval and critical probability
confidence_level = 0.95   
alpha = 1-(confidence_level/1)
critical_probability = 1-(alpha/2)  

#z score for 95% confidence interval
z_score = norm.ppf(critical_probability, 0, 1)  

#standard error of a proportion
SE = np.sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)  

#margin in error
ME = z_score*SE  

# confidence interval 99%
lower_boundary = p-ME
upper_boundary = p+ME

print('The 95% confidence interval for our sample home win % of', (home_win_perc*100).round(2), 'is between', (lower_boundary*100).round(2), '% and', (upper_boundary*100).round(2), '%.')
```

    The 95% confidence interval for our sample home win % of 44.93 is between 42.84 % and 47.02 %.
    


```python
summary_table = epl_matches.groupby(['home_team']).agg({'home_win': ['count', 'sum']})
summary_table.columns = summary_table.columns.droplevel(1)
summary_table.columns = ['matches', 'home_wins']
summary_table['home_win_%'] = round(summary_table['home_wins']/summary_table['matches'], 2)
summary_table = summary_table.sort_values(by=['home_win_%'], ascending=False)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 15)
ax.set(xlim=(0, 1.1), ylabel="")
ax.set_title('Home Win % by team, Seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16')
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=False, offset=None, trim=False)
ax = sns.barplot(y = summary_table.index, x="home_win_%", data=summary_table, palette="Blues_r_d")

for rect in ax.patches:
  # Get X and Y placement of label from rect.
  y_value = rect.get_y() + rect.get_height() / 2
  x_value = rect.get_width()
  
  label = "{0:.1%}".format(x_value)
  
  ax.annotate(label,(x_value+0.05, y_value),ha='center',va='center')
```


    
![png](output_65_0.png)
    


Based on above plot showing the home win % for all teams in our dataset, we see that Manchester City is far above average. This is not surprising considering that they won 2 league titles in the 6 seasons considered, and also finished twice as runners up. <br>

Based on above statistics, Manchester City won on average 8 out of 10 home games. <br>
For Manchester United it was 7 out of 10, followed by Chelsea and Arsenal with approx. 6 out of 10 home wins. <br>

Unfortunately, my team Liverpool was still in a slump during the first half of the 2010s, winning only 5 out of 10 home games on average.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 5)
ax = sns.histplot(data = summary_table, x="home_win_%", bins=10)
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_67_0.png)
    


Based on the histogram of home win % by team, we can see that most teams are clustered around the mean of approx. 40%, however, some teams show strong home performances over the time frame, with home win % above 60%.

#### Away win percentage


```python
away_win_perc = np.sum(epl_matches['away_win'])/epl_matches.shape[0]
print('The away win % in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was', (away_win_perc*100).round(2),'%')
```

    The away win % in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was 28.96 %
    


```python
p = away_win_perc # sample proportion
n = epl_matches.shape[0] #sample size

#95% confidence interval and critical probability
confidence_level = 0.95   
alpha = 1-(confidence_level/1)
critical_probability = 1-(alpha/2)  

#z score for 95% confidence interval
z_score = norm.ppf(critical_probability, 0, 1)  

#standard error of a proportion
SE = np.sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)  

#margin in error
ME = z_score*SE  

# confidence interval 99%
lower_boundary = p-ME
upper_boundary = p+ME

print('The 95% confidence interval for our sample away win % of', (away_win_perc*100).round(2), 'is between', (lower_boundary*100).round(2), '% and', (upper_boundary*100).round(2), '%.')
```

    The 95% confidence interval for our sample away win % of 28.96 is between 27.05 % and 30.86 %.
    


```python
summary_table = epl_matches.groupby(['away_team']).agg({'away_win': ['count', 'sum']})
summary_table.columns = summary_table.columns.droplevel(1)
summary_table.columns = ['matches', 'away_wins']
summary_table['away_win_%'] = round(summary_table['away_wins']/summary_table['matches'], 2)
summary_table = summary_table.sort_values(by=['away_win_%'], ascending=False)

fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 15)
ax.set(xlim=(0, 1.1), ylabel="")
ax.set_title('Away Win % by team, Seasons 2010/11 to 2015/16')
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=False, offset=None, trim=False)
ax = sns.barplot(y = summary_table.index, x="away_win_%", data=summary_table, palette="Blues_r_d")

for rect in ax.patches:
  # Get X and Y placement of label from rect.
  y_value = rect.get_y() + rect.get_height() / 2
  x_value = rect.get_width()
  
  label = "{0:.1%}".format(x_value)
  
  ax.annotate(label,(x_value+0.05, y_value),ha='center',va='center')
```


    
![png](output_72_0.png)
    


In terms of away win %, we see a big drop off versus home win % for the teams on average. <br>

Interestingly at the top, there is a tight range in the away win %, with a difference of only 2% from the first Arsenal with 47% to the fifth Chelsea with 45%.<br>

This indicates that titles and champions league positions were generally decided based on the home win %, as the away performance was even between the top 5.


```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 5)
ax = sns.histplot(data = summary_table, x="away_win_%", bins=10, palette="Blues_d")
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
plt.show()
```


    
![png](output_74_0.png)
    


As with home win %, we see a clear outlier with the top teams on the right, with away win % of above 40%.

Most teams are around the 20% mark in terms of away win %.

#### Draw percentage


```python
draw_perc = np.sum(epl_matches['draw'])/epl_matches.shape[0]
print('The % of games ending in a draw in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was', (draw_perc*100).round(2),'%')
```

    The % of games ending in a draw in our dataset from the 2010/2011 to the 2015/2016 season was 26.11 %
    


```python
p = draw_perc # sample proportion
n = epl_matches.shape[0] #sample size

#95% confidence interval and critical probability
confidence_level = 0.95   
alpha = 1-(confidence_level/1)
critical_probability = 1-(alpha/2)  

#z score for 95% confidence interval
z_score = norm.ppf(critical_probability, 0, 1)  

#standard error of a proportion
SE = np.sqrt(p*(1-p)/n)  

#margin in error
ME = z_score*SE  

# confidence interval 99%
lower_boundary = p-ME
upper_boundary = p+ME

print('The 95% confidence interval for our sample of', (draw_perc*100).round(2), '% of games ending in a draw of is between', (lower_boundary*100).round(2), '% and', (upper_boundary*100).round(2), '%.')
```

    The 95% confidence interval for our sample of 26.11 % of games ending in a draw of is between 24.27 % and 27.96 %.
    

### Goals Scored

Goals scored will unfortunately not help us in predicting the outcome of the match, as this information will not be available at time of match prediction before the game. <br>

For reference and out of interest I have added below plots, but will continue with comments from the player section.

#### Home and away goals scored


```python
fig, (ax1, ax2) = plt.subplots(1, 2)
fig.set_size_inches(20, 5)
sns.histplot(data = epl_matches, x="home_team_goal", bins=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], ax=ax1)
sns.histplot(data = epl_matches, x="away_team_goal", bins=[0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10], ax=ax2)
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
```

### Players

In this section I will analyse the relationship between the player data and the match outcome. <br>

As a proxy for the match outcome, I will use the home win variable, which is one hot encoded to 1, if the home team won the match, and 0 if the match ended in a draw or the away team won.

For all correlation coefficient calculations, I use the pandas [pandas.DataFrame.corr](
https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.corr.html) function. <br>

This returns by default the Pearson correlation for two continuous variables, and the Point-biserial correlation for a continuous with a one hot encoded variable, which is [mathematically equivalent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point-biserial_correlation_coefficient) to the Pearson correlation.

#### Home team starting elevel overall player ratings


```python
home_players = ['home_player_1',	'home_player_2',	'home_player_3',	'home_player_4',	'home_player_5',	'home_player_6',
                   'home_player_7',	'home_player_8',	'home_player_9',	'home_player_10',	'home_player_11']
z = 'overall_rating_'
column_list = []
for player in home_players:
  column_name = z+player
  column_list.append(column_name)
column_list
column_list.append('home_win')

#get correlation matrix
corr = epl_matches[column_list].corr()
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))         # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(10, 130, s=100, n=5)
# Draw the heatmap with the mask and correct aspect ratio
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5}, annot=True)
```

Based on the correlation coefficients of the overall eleven home player ratings with the home win variable, referring to the last row in the correlation matrix, we see that all eleven are positive, indicating the possibility that higher home player ratings lead to a higher chance of a home win. <br>

This indicates that the player ratings could possibly be useful in predicting the chance of a home win. <br>

Interestingly the correlation matrix also shows a high correlation of overall home player ratings with other home player ratings. This indicates that in general, players with higher ratings play in the same team, as do players with lower ratings play in the same team.

#### Away team starting elevel overall player ratings


```python
away_players = ['away_player_1',	'away_player_2',	'away_player_3',	'away_player_4',	'away_player_5',	'away_player_6',
                   'away_player_7',	'away_player_8',	'away_player_9',	'away_player_10',	'away_player_11']

Based on the correlation coefficients of the overall eleven away player ratings with the home win variable, referring to the last row in the correlation matrix, we see that all eleven are negative, indicating the possibility that higher away player ratings lead to a lower chance of a home win. <br>

This indicates that the player ratings could possibly be useful in predicting the chance of a home win. <br>

Interestingly the correlation matrix also shows a high correlation of overall away player ratings with other away player ratings. This indicates that in general, players with higher ratings play in the same team, as do players with lower ratings play in the same team.

Based on the correlation coefficients for all eleven home player attributes with the home win variable, referring to the last row in the correlation matrix, we see that the correlation coefficients are either slightly positive or close to 0. Interestingly, depending on the position of the player, different attributes seem to correlate higher.

Player 1 is clearly the goalkeeper, as here goalkeeping attributes correlate higher with the home win variable, indicating that a stronger goalkeeper could lead to more home wins. <br>

For player 3 and 4, tackling and marking attributes correlate higher with the home win variable, indicating that these players are defenders, and stronger defensive attributes could lead to more home wins.

For players 6, 7, 8, 9, a mixture of vision, passing and dribbling attributes correlate higher with home wins, indicating that these are midfield players.

Players 9, 10, 11 seems to be the main goal scorers, as here the finishing ability correlates higher with the home win variable.

As we would expect, we see the opposite picture for the away player attribute correlations with the home win variable.

Based on the correlation coefficients for all eleven away player attributes with the home win variable, referring to the last row in the correlation matrix, we see that the correlation coefficients are either slightly negative or close to 0. As with the home player attributes, depending on the position of the player, different attributes seem to correlate more negative.

Player 1 is clearly the goalkeeper, as here goalkeeping attributes correlate more negative with the home win variable, indicating that a stronger away goalkeeper could lead to less home wins.<br>

For player 3 and 4, tackling and marking attributes correlate more negative with the home win variable, indicating that these players are defenders, and stronger defensive attributes for away players could lead to less home wins.

For players 6, 7, 8, 9, a mixture of vision, passing and dribbling attributes correlate more negative with home wins, indicating that these are midfield players.

Players 9, 10, seem to be the main goal scorers, as here the finishing ability correlates more negative with the home win variable.

### Teams

In the next section I look at the correlation of team attributes with the home win variable. As noted during the data processing part, the very infrequent updates of the team attributes could make them less useful as predictive features. <br>

Also, to note is that unlike for players, there is no overall rating variable, but only team attributes.

#### Home team attributes


```python
home_team_attributes = list(epl_matches.columns[10:30])
home_team_attributes.append('home_win')
epl_matches[home_team_attributes].corr()

corr = epl_matches[home_team_attributes].corr()
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))         # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(10, 130, s=100, n=5)
# Draw the heatmap with the mask and correct aspect ratio
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5}, annot=True)
```

Unfortunately, the home team features seem to not correlate at all with the home win variable. There are even some small negative correlations, indicating stronger home team attributes could lead to fewer home wins.

As noted, this contradiction could be due to the issue that the data was not updated very frequently and is therefore not useful for prediction compared to player data, which was updated very frequently.

#### Away team attributes


```python
home_team_attributes = list(epl_matches.columns[30:50])
home_team_attributes.append('home_win')
epl_matches[home_team_attributes].corr()

corr = epl_matches[home_team_attributes].corr()
mask = np.triu(np.ones_like(corr, dtype=bool))         # Generate a mask for the upper triangle
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
fig.set_size_inches(10, 10)
cmap = sns.diverging_palette(10, 130, s=100, n=5)
# Draw the heatmap with the mask and correct aspect ratio
sns.heatmap(corr, mask=mask, cmap=cmap, vmax=.3, center=0, square=True, linewidths=.5, cbar_kws={"shrink": .5}, annot=True)
```

Unfortunately, the away team features show the same situation as the home team features.
The away team features seem to not correlate at all with the home win variable. There are even some small positive correlations, indicating stronger away team attributes could lead to more home wins.

As noted, this contradiction could be due to the issue that the data was not updated very frequently, and is therefore not useful for prediction compared to player data, which was updated very frequently.

### Conclusion from Exploratory Data Analysis

Based on the analysis of player and team data, the player data clearly shows the correlations one would expect.
Stronger home team players correlate positively with the home win variable, whereas stronger away team players correlate negatively with the home win variable. Depending on the position of the players, different variables correlate stronger with the home win variable. <br>
Based on above I conclude that we should keep the player data as the correlations indicate they could be useful for predicting the match result.
Some player attributes may be less useful than others, based on the position of the player. To reduce the feature dimension later, I will therefore use Principal Component Analysis, to reduce the feature space but keeping most of the information in the data. <br>

Unfortunately, as feared due to the very infrequent updates, the team attribute data seems to not be especially useful for predicting the match results. Considering the non-existing correlations with the home win variable and our already high feature dimension space, I will remove all team attribute variables from the data set before training machine learning algorithms.

The following code drops all team attribute variables. <br>

In addition, I will also drop all result columns except the home win column. This will be used as a proxy to try to predict the result, in this case a home win.


```python
#remove team colums
team_attribute_columns = list(epl_matches.columns[10:50])
data = epl_matches.drop(labels = team_attribute_columns, axis=1)
data.head(5)
```

## Part 2.2 Machine Learning
In the final part of this notebook, I will train several classifiers to predict the home win variable based on player data of the 11 starting players in both the home and away teams. The home win outcome variable is one hot encoded, with 1 if the home team won and 0 in case the game ended in a draw or the away team won.

In the next few lines of code, the data is split into features and labels, and after split into training and test data. The test data will be put aside and only used at the very end, to get an out of sample error estimation for the final selected model.

All model training and hyper parameter tuning is done on the training set with cross validation.


```python
# split data into independant variables X (player attributes) and dependant variable y (home win)
X_data = data.drop(columns=['home_win'])
y_data = data['home_win']
```


```python
#split data into train and test data
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X_data, y_data, shuffle=True, test_size=0.3, random_state=42, stratify = y_data)
```


```python
# overview X train
X_train.head(5)
```

### Model training
For Machine Learning I will use the standard classical ML library sklearn. This offers all functionality required.

For each model being trained, the training data will be passed through a pre-processing pipeline, in which the categorical columns are converted with the OneHotEncoder, numerical columns are transformed to range between 0 and 1 with the MinMaxScaler, after which the data dimension is reduced with the PCA algorithm. Using the data pipeline instead of transforming the training data before using cross validation ensures that there is no data leakage between train and validation folds. During cross validation, only the folds in the training set are used to fit the pipeline before transforming both train folds and the held-out validation fold, without incorporating information from the held-out validation fold during the fitting.<br>

Only after passing through the above pipeline, does the model training begin.
For hyperparameter tuning for several models, 5-fold cross validation is used in combination with grid search, to find the best hyperparameters measured by the highest average accuracy on the validation sets. 

After all models are trained, the model with the highest average cross validation error is chosen.

To get a true out of sample error estimation, the best model is then used to predict the unseen test set data.

The baseline classifier is a good refence to see how well our models are doing. Just by prediction the majority class 0, which is no home win, results in an average cross validation accuracy of 55%. We would hope that good models would reach an accuracy far higher than 55%.

In the next few lines of code, I train ten different models, after which I compare the validation accuracy of all models.

### Out of sample error estimation


```python
#get test set predictions for best model
y_test_pred =  grid_clf4.predict(X_test)

#print performance metrics on test set
print('Precision score:', precision_score(y_test, y_test_pred).round(3))
print('Recall score:', recall_score(y_test, y_test_pred).round(3))
print('Accuracy score:', accuracy_score(y_test, y_test_pred).round(3))

#print confusion matrix on test set
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, y_test_pred)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
ax = sns.heatmap(conf_matrix, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap='Blues');
ax.set_title('Confusion Matrix', fontsize = 14, fontweight ='bold')
ax.set_xlabel('Predicted Class', fontweight ='bold') 
ax.set_ylabel('True Class', fontweight ='bold')
```

    Precision score: 0.645
    Recall score: 0.507
    Accuracy score: 0.653

Based on the highest cross validation accuracy, the Logistic Regression model was chosen as the best model.

The out of sample accuracy achieved was 65.3%.

## Part 2.3 Conclusion
The goal of the project was to see whether one could use the FIFA game data to predict match outcomes. In my analysis I used the home win variable as a proxy for the match outcome.
The baseline model simply predicting the majority class reaches about 55% accuracy. The final model trained best on the highest average cross validation accuracy, in this case a logistic regression model, reached an out of sample accuracy of 65% on the test set.

This is 10% better than simple predicting the majority class, but lower than hoped for. <br>

Potential improvements for future research would be to get better and more frequently updated team specific data, as this was unfortunately not the case in this dataset.

Other improvements could come from using other data sources in combination with the FIFA data, or training more complex models on the challenge such as Neural Networks to achieve a higher accuracy.
