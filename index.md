# Predicting the beautiful game, with a game of the beautiful game

## Premier League Match Predictions with FIFA game data

Ever since playing the beautiful game as a child, watching my first football game of Liverpool FC and my first world cup in 1998, the game has not stopped fascinating me. Not surprisingly, this has also led to a fascination with the FIFA football game. The data collected by EA Sports for the FIFA football game has been ever expanding and becoming increasingly real time. Player and team statistics used to be updated once a year with the new game release, but nowadays, player and team statistics get updated regularly during the season, reflecting players and teams in and out of form, as well as new players emerging during the season. <br>

With the increasing close to real time data collected for the FIFA football game, I pose the question whether it is possible to predict the outcome of a match, based on data from the FIFA football game?

As a premise we put ourselves in the shoes of many football fans out there.
We are sitting in front of our game console, playing the latest FIFA game. It's one hour before kickoff of the match of our favorite Premier League football team. As usual, the team news for both teams has just been released.
Can we predict the outcome of the Premier League match, based on the FIFA game statistics of the announced starting eleven of both sides?

Before we can answer this question, we will have to prepare the data for analysis, which will be part 1 of this notebook.<br>

Part two will then continue with Exploratory Data Analysis, to gain some insights from the data. After we will run several machine learning algorithms, to try to predict the outcome of the game.


## Part 1 Data Pre-processing

Before we can start, we will first need a dataset. For this project I will be using the "European Soccer Database". <br>
The dataset can be found under the following link on Kaggle: [Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/hugomathien/soccer)

The dataset contains match information for 25,000 matches, spanning seasons 2008/2009 to 2015/2016. In addition, it contains the player and team data for the same seasons from the FIFA football game. As the data is saved on an SQL database, in the first part of the next section we will extract the data from the database, before merging the match, player and team information into one data frame.

### Data Extraction from SQLlite Database
For the data extraction in SQL, I will be using the sqlite3 library. This offers a seamless transition from SQL to pandas, as we can directly extract the data from the database with sql queries into a Pandas Dataframe.



```python
import pandas as pd # data processing
import sqlite3 #SQL library to extract data from sql database

#display max columns and rows, to be able to inspect big data tables
pd.set_option('display.max_columns', None)
pd.set_option('display.max_rows', None)
```

Below line is to connect the google colab instance to google drive. If run outside colab, below code is ignored.


```python
# conntects to google drive if ran in colab
# ignored if ran outside of colab

if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):
  from google.colab import drive
  drive.mount('/content/drive')
```

The following code first connects to the SQL database saved in the folder under the 'path' variable in case it is ran within colab. If ran outside of colab, the SQL database should be saved in the same folder as the notebook.


```python
# connect to SQL database in google drive if ran in colab. 
# connet to SQL database in notebook folder if ran outside of colab

if 'google.colab' in str(get_ipython()):
    path = '/content/drive/My Drive/Colab Notebooks/Python_Data_Programming_Coursework/'
else:
    path = str()
database = path + 'database.sqlite'
conn = sqlite3.connect(database)
```

The next few lines of code first extract an overview of all tables in the database. Then I download the tables from the SQL database into a dataframe with the sqlite3 library.

It may be possible to extract the data in a more efficient manner, merging several tables during the extraction. However, as the SQL query code would get involved, I decided to do most of the table merging activity in Pandas.

For the "Match" table, in the first download I only extract five entries, to get an understanding of the column structure. This is the base table which will be used to merge the player and team data on.


```python
# get overview of tables in SQL database
tables = pd.read_sql("""SELECT *
                      FROM sqlite_master
                      WHERE type='table';""", conn)
tables
```

The below code forms our base match table, to later merge the player and team data into.
To enable us to merge the detailed player data and the team data into the match table later, I keep that player and team IDs, which will be used as keys to merge the match table with the Player Attributes and Team Attributes tables. <br>
To limit the download of unnecessary data, I join the Match table with the Country and League tables before extraction, then limit the extraction to matches where the Country name is "England". This limits the extraction to Premier League matches only.

### Data merging and pre-processing in Pandas
Now that we have the base match table, the next challenge is to merge the team and player data into the match table. 

Our end goal is to have a table where each row represents a match, including the latest team and player data from the FIFA game, and the match result.
With this structure we can later use the table for Exploratory Data Analysis and Machine Learning.

To add the team data, I first check when the team data was updated.
Unfortunately, it seems like the team data was not updated regularly in our database. This may become problematic for the usefulness of the team data for match prediction.



```python
# unique dates of team data information
list(team_attributes.date.unique())
```




    ['2010-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2014-09-19 00:00:00',
     '2015-09-10 00:00:00',
     '2011-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2012-02-22 00:00:00',
     '2013-09-20 00:00:00']



To ensure that no information from the future is used in predicting the match outcome, it must be ensured that the team and player data used to predict the match outcome, is information from before the match.

To ensure this for the team data, I build a dictionary linking the latest update of the team data to the closest season after.

This will be used together with the team IDs to merge the team attributes data into the match table, for both the home team and the away team.


```python
#create team data dictionary to ensure no data leakage
dictionary_season = {'2010-02-22 00:00:00': '2010/2011',
                     '2011-02-22 00:00:00': '2011/2012',
                     '2012-02-22 00:00:00': '2012/2013',
                     '2013-09-20 00:00:00': '2013/2014',
                     '2014-09-19 00:00:00': '2014/2015',
                    '2015-09-10 00:00:00': '2015/2016'
                     }
```

The following next few lines of code add the season column to the player attributes data, based on above dictionary. <br>

Then I merge the team attributes table twice into the match table. Once for the home team based on the home team ID and once for the away team based on the away team ID. <br>

The new columns can be seen on the right side of the match table.


```python
# add season column to team attributes tablle, based on above dictionary mapping
team_attributes['season'] = team_attributes ['date'].map(dictionary_season)
```


```python
#merge home team attributes into the match table
epl_matches = epl_matches.merge(team_attributes, how='inner', left_on=['season', 'home_team_api_id'], right_on=['season', 'team_api_id'])

#add home team marker to home team attributes column
old_column_list = []
new_column_list = []
for column in team_attributes.columns.drop('season'):
  old_column_list.append(column)
  new_column_list.append(column+str('_home_team'))
for i in range(len(old_column_list)):
  epl_matches = epl_matches.rename(columns={old_column_list[i]: new_column_list[i]})

epl_matches.head(5)
```

Before moving on to the player data, the next few lines check for missing data points, and delete columns with most team attribute values missing.

I also delete some rows where ID information is missing. As these are not measured values but arbitrary IDs, imputing the values is not an option is this case.


```python
# check for total number of matches in dataset
total_num_matches = epl_matches.shape[0]
total_num_matches
```




    2280




```python
# check for missing values
epl_matches.isna().sum()
```

```python
# remove two team attribute columns, as most values missing
epl_matches = epl_matches.drop(columns=['buildUpPlayDribbling_home_team', 'buildUpPlayDribbling_away_team'])
```


```python
# remove rows with missing values
epl_matches = epl_matches.dropna()
print(total_num_matches - epl_matches.shape[0],'out of',total_num_matches,'matches were deleted from the dataset due to missing team attribute or player ID information')
```

    39 out of 2280 matches were deleted from the dataset due to missing team attribute or player ID information
    

Next, I merge the player data for the 11 starting players on each side, in total 22 players into the match table. <br>

To do this I define a column list for the player ID columns in the match table, then loop through the column list and merge the player attributes list into the match table for each player ID.<br>

To ensure that we only merge player data into the match table, that was available before the match date, I use the pandas.merge_asof function.
Refer to following link in the [pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.merge_asof.html). Quoting the pandas documentation:<em>" A “backward” search selects the last row in the right DataFrame whose ‘on’ key is less than or equal to the left’s key."</em><br>

Therefore, if we sort both tables by the date key ascending, we can ensure that during the merge process, the date key in the right table, in this case player attributes, will be less than or equal to the date in the match table. With this we have ensured that the player data extracted is from before the match date.


```python
# number of unique update dates in player attribute table
Player_Attributes.date.unique().shape
```




    (197,)




```python
# generate player ID column list, which will be used as keys to merge the match table with the player attributes table
team_players = ['home_player_1',
                'home_player_2', 
                'home_player_3', 
                'home_player_4', 
                'home_player_5',
                'home_player_6', 
                'home_player_7', 
                'home_player_8', 
                'home_player_9',
                'home_player_10',
                'home_player_11',
                'away_player_1', 
                'away_player_2',
                'away_player_3', 
                'away_player_4', 
                'away_player_5', 
                'away_player_6',
                'away_player_7', 
                'away_player_8', 
                'away_player_9', 
                'away_player_10',
                'away_player_11']

#below two loops ensure player ID columns have the correct formatting
for player in team_players:
  epl_matches[player] = pd.to_numeric(epl_matches[player])

for player in team_players:
  epl_matches[player] = epl_matches[player].astype('int64')
```


```python
#ensure correct date formatting of date columns
epl_matches['match_date'] = pd.to_datetime(epl_matches['match_date'])
Player_Attributes['date'] = pd.to_datetime(Player_Attributes['date'])

#sort both match and player attribute tables by date ascending.
epl_matches = epl_matches.sort_values(by='match_date', ascending=True)
Player_Attributes = Player_Attributes.sort_values(by='date', ascending=True)
```


```python
# merge the player attributes of all 22 starting players into the match table
for player in team_players:
  epl_matches = pd.merge_asof(epl_matches, Player_Attributes, left_on='match_date', right_on='date', left_by = player, right_by ='player_api_id', direction='backward', suffixes= ("","_"+player))
```


```python
# add missing ending label for home player one column names
for i in epl_matches.columns[72:113]:
  epl_matches = epl_matches.rename(columns={i: i+str('_home_player_1')})
```

After merging the player attribute table 22 times into the match table, we have the player attributes for all 22 starting players for each match.
Refer to the columns on the right of below table, to see the player attributes.


```python
# overview of match table after merging in player data for 22 starting players
epl_matches.head(5)

## Part 2.1 Exploratory Data Analysis

In part two of this notebook, we will explore the match table to gain some insights of the premier league match data. <br>

Considering our final goal of prediction, the match outcome, I will first analyse the match outcome data and then further expand our analysis and try to find variables which could help us predict the match outcome. <br>

For Exploratory Data Analysis I will be using below four libraries.
1. Numpy for scientific computing
2. Scipy for statistical analysis
3. Matplotlib for data visualization
4. Seaborn for data visualization


```python
import numpy as np #scientific computing/linear algebra
from scipy.stats import norm #scientific computing library. Used for confidence interval calculations

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt #data visualization
import seaborn as sns #data visualization
```

Before going deeper into the analysis, let us quickly get a general idea of the scope and shape of our match table.


```python
print("The match table covers the following premier league seasons:", np.unique(epl_matches['season']))
```

    The match table covers the following premier league seasons: ['2010/2011' '2011/2012' '2012/2013' '2013/2014' '2014/2015' '2015/2016']
    


```python
print("In total we have", epl_matches.shape[0], "matches in the dataset.")
```

    In total we have 2179 matches in the dataset.
    

### Match result
First let us analyse the overall match result.
Below bar chart shows the count of the three different match outcomes. <br>
Note that the data we are considering covers below two seasons.




```python
sns.catplot(x="result", data=epl_matches,  kind="count")
sns.despine(fig=None, ax=None, top=True, right=True, left=True, bottom=True, offset=None, trim=False)
```

Clearly home wins make up the biggest portion of the match results. <br>
The number of draws and away wins are close to each other, with slightly more away wins than draws overall.


```python
summary_table = epl_matches.groupby(['season']).agg({'home_win': ['sum'], 'away_win': ['sum'], 'draw': ['sum']})
summary_table.columns = summary_table.columns.droplevel(1)

for i in range(summary_table.shape[0]):
  summary_table.iloc[i] = summary_table.iloc[i]/np.sum(summary_table.iloc[i])

summary_table.columns = ['home_win_%', 'away_win_%', "draw_%"]

summary_table
```
